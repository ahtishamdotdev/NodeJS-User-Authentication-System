## Example

```js
var expand = require('brace-expansion');

expand('file-{a,b,c}.jpg')


expand('-v{,,}')


expand('file{0..2}.jpg')


expand('file-{a..c}.jpg')


expand('file{2..0}.jpg')


expand('file{0..4..2}.jpg')


expand('file-{a..e..2}.jpg')


expand('file{00..10..5}.jpg')


expand('{{A..C},{a..c}}')


expand('ppp{,config,oe{,conf}}')

```

## API

```js
var expand = require('brace-expansion');
```

### var expanded = expand(str)

Return an array of all possible and valid expansions of `str`. If none are
found, `[str]` is returned.

Valid expansions are:

```js
/^(.*,)+(.+)?$/

```

A comma separated list of options, like `{a,b}` or `{a,{b,c}}` or `{,a,}`.

```js
/^-?\d+\.\.-?\d+(\.\.-?\d+)?$/

```

A numeric sequence from `x` to `y` inclusive, with optional increment.
If `x` or `y` start with a leading `0`, all the numbers will be padded
to have equal length. Negative numbers and backwards iteration work too.

```js
/^-?\d+\.\.-?\d+(\.\.-?\d+)?$/

```

An alphabetic sequence from `x` to `y` inclusive, with optional increment.
`x` and `y` must be exactly one character, and if given, `incr` must be a
number.

For compatibility reasons, the string `${` is not eligible for brace expansion.

## Installation

With [npm](https:
