# normalize-path [![NPM version](https:

> Normalize slashes in a file path to be posix/unix-like forward slashes. Also condenses repeat slashes to a single slash and removes and trailing slashes, unless disabled.

Please consider following this project's author, [Jon Schlinkert](https:

## Install

Install with [npm](https:

```sh
$ npm install --save normalize-path
```

## Usage

```js
const normalize = require('normalize-path');

console.log(normalize('\\foo\\bar\\baz\\')); 

```

**win32 namespaces**

```js
console.log(normalize('\\\\?\\UNC\\Server01\\user\\docs\\Letter.txt')); 


console.log(normalize('\\\\.\\CdRomX')); 

```

**Consecutive slashes**

Condenses multiple consecutive forward slashes (except for leading slashes in win32 namespaces) to a single slash.

```js
console.log(normalize('.

```

### Trailing slashes

By default trailing slashes are removed. Pass `false` as the last argument to disable this behavior and _**keep** trailing slashes_:

```js
console.log(normalize('foo\\bar\\baz\\', false)); 
console.log(normalize('./foo/bar/baz/', false)); 
```
