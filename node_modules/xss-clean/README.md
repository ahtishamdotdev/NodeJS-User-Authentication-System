- [License](#license)

## How to Use
```bash
npm install xss-clean --save
```

```javascript
const restify = require('restify')
const xss = require('xss-clean')

const app = restify.createServer()

app.use(restify.bodyParser())


app.use(xss())

app.listen(8080)
```

This will sanitize any data in `req.body`, `req.query`, and `req.params`. You can also access the API directly if you don't want to use as middleware.

```javascript
const clean = require('xss-clean/lib/xss').clean

const cleaned = clean('<script></script>')

```
