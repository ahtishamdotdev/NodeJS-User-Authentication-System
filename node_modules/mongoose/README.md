Pull requests are always welcome! Please base pull requests against the `master`
branch and follow the [contributing guide](https:

If your pull requests makes documentation changes, please do **not**
modify any `.html` files. The `.html` files are compiled code, so please make
your changes in `docs });

**Important!** If you opened a separate connection using `mongoose.createConnection()` but attempt to access the model through `mongoose.model('ModelName')` it will not work as expected since it is not hooked up to an active db connection. In this case access your model through the connection you created:

```js
const conn = mongoose.createConnection('your connection string');
const MyModel = conn.model('ModelName', schema);
const m = new MyModel();
await m.save(); 
```

vs

```js
const conn = mongoose.createConnection('your connection string');
const MyModel = mongoose.model('ModelName', schema);
const m = new MyModel();
await m.save(); 
```

### Embedded Documents

In the first example snippet, we defined a key in the Schema that looks like:

```txt
comments: [Comment]
```

Where `Comment` is a `Schema` we created. This means that creating embedded documents is as simple as:

```js

const BlogPost = mongoose.model('BlogPost');


const post = new BlogPost();


post.comments.push({ title: 'My comment' });

await post.save();
```

The same goes for removing them:

```js
const post = await BlogPost.findById(myId);
post.comments[0].deleteOne();
await post.save();
```

Embedded documents enjoy all the same features as your models. Defaults, validators, middleware.

### Middleware

See the [docs](http:

#### Intercepting and mutating method arguments

You can intercept method arguments via middleware.

For example, this would allow you to broadcast changes about your Documents every time someone `set`s a path in your Document to a new value:

```js
schema.pre('set', function(next, path, val, typel) {
  
  this.emit('set', path, val);

  
  next();
});
```

Moreover, you can mutate the incoming `method` arguments so that subsequent middleware see different values for those arguments. To do so, just pass the new values to `next`:

```js
schema.pre(method, function firstPre(next, methodArg1, methodArg2) {
  
  next('altered-' + methodArg1.toString(), methodArg2);
});


schema.pre(method, function secondPre(next, methodArg1, methodArg2) {
  console.log(methodArg1);
  

  console.log(methodArg2);
  

  
  
  
  
  next();
});
```

#### Schema gotcha

`type`, when used in a schema has special meaning within Mongoose. If your schema requires using `type` as a nested property you must use object notation:

```js
new Schema({
  broken: { type: Boolean },
  asset: {
    name: String,
    type: String 
  }
});

new Schema({
  works: { type: Boolean },
  asset: {
    name: String,
    type: { type: String } 
  }
});
```

### Driver Access

Mongoose is built on top of the [official MongoDB Node.js driver](https:
notable exception that `YourModel.collection` still buffers
commands. As such, `YourModel.collection.find()` will **not**
return a cursor.
