# is-glob [![NPM version](https:

> Returns `true` if the given string looks like a glob pattern or an extglob pattern. This makes it easy to create code that only uses external modules like node-glob when necessary, resulting in much faster code execution and initialization time, and a better user experience.

Please consider following this project's author, [Jon Schlinkert](https:

## Install

Install with [npm](https:

```sh
$ npm install --save is-glob
```

## Usage

```js
var isGlob = require('is-glob');
```

### Default behavior

**True**

Patterns that have glob characters or regex patterns will return `true`:

```js
isGlob('!foo.js');
isGlob('*.js');
isGlob('**/abc.js');
isGlob('abcabc.js');
isGlob('abc/\\*.js');
isGlob('abc/\\(aaa|bbb).js');
isGlob('abc/\\[a-z].js');
isGlob('abc/\\{a,b}.js');

```

Patterns that do not have glob patterns return `false`:

```js
isGlob('abc.js');
isGlob('abc/def/ghi.js');
isGlob('foo.js');
isGlob('abc/@.js');
isGlob('abc/+.js');
isGlob('abc/?.js');
isGlob();
isGlob(null);

```

Arrays are also `false` (If you want to check if an array has a glob pattern, use [has-glob](https:

```js
isGlob(['**abc.js', {strict: false});
isGlob('abcabc.js', {strict: false});
isGlob('abc/\\*.js', {strict: false});
isGlob('abc/\\(aaa|bbb).js', {strict: false});
isGlob('abc/\\[a-z].js', {strict: false});
isGlob('abc/\\{a,b}.js', {strict: false});

```
