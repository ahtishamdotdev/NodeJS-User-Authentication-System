A cross platform solution to node's spawn and spawnSync.

## Installation

Node.js version 8 and up:
`$ npm install cross-spawn`

Node.js version 7 and under:
`$ npm install cross-spawn@6`

## Why

Node has issues when using spawn on Windows:

- It ignores [PATHEXT](https:
- It does not support [shebangs](https:
- Has problems running commands with [spaces](https:
- Has problems running commands with posix relative paths (e.g.: `./my-folder/my-executable`)
- Has an [issue](https:
- No `options.shell` support on node `<v4.8`

All these issues are handled correctly by `cross-spawn`.
There are some known modules, such as [win-spawn](https:


## Usage

Exactly the same way as node's [`spawn`](https:


```js
const spawn = require('cross-spawn');


const child = spawn('npm', ['list', '-g', '-depth', '0'], { stdio: 'inherit' });


const result = spawn.sync('npm', ['list', '-g', '-depth', '0'], { stdio: 'inherit' });
```


## Caveats

### Using `options.shell` as an alternative to `cross-spawn`

Starting from node `v4.8`, `spawn` has a `shell` option that allows you run commands from within a shell. This new option solves
the [PATHEXT](https:

- It's not supported in node `<v4.8`
- You must manually escape the command and arguments which is very error prone, specially when passing user input
- There are a lot of other unresolved issues from the [Why](#why) section that you must take into account

If you are using the `shell` option to spawn a command in a cross platform way, consider using `cross-spawn` instead. You have been warned.

### `options.shell` support

While `cross-spawn` adds support for `options.shell` in node `<v4.8`, all of its enhancements are disabled.

This mimics the Node.js behavior. More specifically, the command and its arguments will not be automatically escaped nor shebang support will be offered. This is by design because if you are using `options.shell` you are probably targeting a specific platform anyway and you don't want things to get into your way.

### Shebangs support

While `cross-spawn` handles shebangs on Windows, its support is limited. More specifically, it just supports `#!/usr/bin/env <program>` where `<program>` must not contain any arguments.   
If you would like to have the shebang support improved, feel free to contribute via a pull-request.

Remember to always test your code on Windows!
