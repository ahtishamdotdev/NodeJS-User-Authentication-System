HTTP response freshness testing

## Installation

This is a [Node.js](https:
[npm registry](https:
[`npm install` command](https:

```
$ npm install fresh
```

## API

```js
var fresh = require('fresh')
```

### fresh(reqHeaders, resHeaders)

Check freshness of the response using request and response headers.

When the response is still "fresh" in the client's cache `true` is
returned, otherwise `false` is returned to indicate that the client
cache is now stale and the full response should be sent.

When a client sends the `Cache-Control: no-cache` request header to
indicate an end-to-end reload request, this module will return `false`
to make handling these requests transparent.

## Known Issues

This module is designed to only follow the HTTP specifications, not
to work-around all kinda of client bugs (especially since this module
typically does not receive enough information to understand what the
client actually is).

There is a known issue that in certain versions of Safari, Safari
will incorrectly make a request that allows this module to validate
freshness of the resource even when Safari does not have a
representation of the resource in the cache. The module
[jumanji](https:
an Express application to work-around this issue and also provides
links to further reading on this Safari bug.

## Example

### API usage

<!-- eslint-disable no-redeclare -->

```js
var reqHeaders = { 'if-none-match': '"foo"' }
var resHeaders = { etag: '"bar"' }
fresh(reqHeaders, resHeaders)


var reqHeaders = { 'if-none-match': '"foo"' }
var resHeaders = { etag: '"foo"' }
fresh(reqHeaders, resHeaders)

```

### Using with Node.js http server

```js
var fresh = require('fresh')
var http = require('http')

var server = http.createServer(function (req, res) {
  
  

  if (isFresh(req, res)) {
    
    res.statusCode = 304
    res.end()
    return
  }

  
  res.statusCode = 200
  res.end('hello, world!')
})

function isFresh (req, res) {
  return fresh(req.headers, {
    etag: res.getHeader('ETag'),
    'last-modified': res.getHeader('Last-Modified')
  })
}

server.listen(3000)
```
