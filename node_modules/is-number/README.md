# is-number [![NPM version](https:

> Returns true if the value is a finite number.

Please consider following this project's author, [Jon Schlinkert](https:

## Install

Install with [npm](https:

```sh
$ npm install --save is-number
```

## Why is this needed?

In JavaScript, it's not always as straightforward as it should be to reliably check if a value is a number. It's common for devs to use `+`, `-`, or `Number()` to cast a string value to a number (for example, when values are returned from user input, regex matches, parsers, etc). But there are many non-intuitive edge cases that yield unexpected results:

```js
console.log(+[]); 
console.log(+''); 
console.log(+'   '); 
console.log(typeof NaN); 
```

This library offers a performant way to smooth out edge cases like these.

## Usage

```js
const isNumber = require('is-number');
```

See the [tests](./test.js) for more examples.

### true

```js
isNumber(5e3);               
isNumber(0xff);              
isNumber(-1.1);              
isNumber(0);                 
isNumber(1);                 
isNumber(1.1);               
isNumber(10);                
isNumber(10.10);             
isNumber(100);               
isNumber('-1.1');            
isNumber('0');               
isNumber('012');             
isNumber('0xff');            
isNumber('1');               
isNumber('1.1');             
isNumber('10');              
isNumber('10.10');           
isNumber('100');             
isNumber('5e3');             
isNumber(parseInt('012'));   
isNumber(parseFloat('012')); 
```

### False

Everything else is false, as you would expect:

```js
isNumber(Infinity);          
isNumber(NaN);               
isNumber(null);              
isNumber(undefined);         
isNumber('');                
isNumber('   ');             
isNumber('foo');             
isNumber([1]);               
isNumber([]);                
isNumber(function () {});    
isNumber({});                
```

## Release history

### 7.0.0

* Refactor. Now uses `.isFinite` if it exists.
* Performance is about the same as v6.0 when the value is a string or number. But it's now 3x-4x faster when the value is not a string or number.

### 6.0.0

* Optimizations, thanks to @benaadams.

### 5.0.0

**Breaking changes**

* removed support for `instanceof Number` and `instanceof String`
