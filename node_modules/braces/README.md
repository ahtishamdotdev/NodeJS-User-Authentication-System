# braces [![Donate](https:

> Bash-like brace expansion, implemented in JavaScript. Safer than other brace expansion libs, with complete support for the Bash 4.3 braces specification, without sacrificing speed.

Please consider following this project's author, [Jon Schlinkert](https:

## Install

Install with [npm](https:

```sh
$ npm install --save braces
```

## v3.0.0 Released!!

See the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for details.

## Why use braces?

Brace patterns make globs more powerful by adding the ability to match specific ranges and sequences of characters.

- **Accurate** - complete support for the [Bash 4.3 Brace Expansion](www.gnu.org/software/bash/) specification (passes all of the Bash braces tests)
- **[fast and performant](#benchmarks)** - Starts fast, runs fast and [scales well](#performance) as patterns increase in complexity.
- **Organized code base** - The parser and compiler are easy to maintain and update when edge cases crop up.
- **Well-tested** - Thousands of test assertions, and passes all of the Bash, minimatch, and [brace-expansion](https:
- **Safer** - You shouldn't have to worry about users defining aggressive or malicious brace patterns that can break your application. Braces takes measures to prevent malicious regex that can be used for DDoS attacks (see [catastrophic backtracking](https:
- [Supports lists](#lists) - (aka "sets") `a/{b,c}/d` => `['a/b/d', 'a/c/d']`
- [Supports sequences](#sequences) - (aka "ranges") `{01..03}` => `['01', '02', '03']`
- [Supports steps](#steps) - (aka "increments") `{2..10..2}` => `['2', '4', '6', '8', '10']`
- [Supports escaping](#escaping) - To prevent evaluation of special characters.

## Usage

The main export is a function that takes one or more brace `patterns` and `options`.

```js
const braces = require('braces');


console.log(braces(['{01..05}', '{a..e}']));


console.log(braces(['{01..05}', '{a..e}'], { expand: true }));

```

### Brace Expansion vs. Compilation

By default, brace patterns are compiled into strings that are optimized for creating regular expressions and matching.

**Compiled**

```js
console.log(braces('a/{x,y,z}/b'));

console.log(braces(['a/{01..20}/b', 'a/{1..5}/b']));

```

**Expanded**

Enable brace expansion by setting the `expand` option to true, or by using [braces.expand()](#expand) (returns an array similar to what you'd expect from Bash, or `echo {1..5}`, or [minimatch](https:

```js
console.log(braces('a/{x,y,z}/b', { expand: true }));


console.log(braces.expand('{01..10}'));

```

### Lists

Expand lists (like Bash "sets"):

```js
console.log(braces('a/{foo,bar,baz}{1..3}/*` would match any of following strings:

```
foo/1/bar
foo/2/bar
foo/3/bar
baz/1/qux
baz/2/qux
baz/3/qux
```

## Brace matching pitfalls

Although brace patterns offer a user-friendly way of matching ranges or sets of strings, there are also some major disadvantages and potential risks you should be aware of.

### tldr

**"brace bombs"**

- brace expansion can eat up a huge amount of processing resources
- as brace patterns increase _linearly in size_, the system resources required to expand the pattern increase exponentially
- users can accidentally (or intentially) exhaust your system's resources resulting in the equivalent of a DoS attack (bonus: no programming knowledge is required!)

For a more detailed explanation with examples, see the [geometric complexity](#geometric-complexity) section.

### The solution

Jump to the [performance section](#performance) to see how Braces solves this problem in comparison to other libraries.

### Geometric complexity

At minimum, brace patterns with sets limited to two elements have quadradic or `O(n^2)` complexity. But the complexity of the algorithm increases exponentially as the number of sets, _and elements per set_, increases, which is `O(n^c)`.

For example, the following sets demonstrate quadratic (`O(n^2)`) complexity:

```
{1,2}{3,4}      => (2X2)    => 13 14 23 24
{1,2}{3,4}{5,6} => (2X2X2)  => 135 136 145 146 235 236 245 246
```

But add an element to a set, and we get a n-fold Cartesian product with `O(n^c)` complexity:

```
{1,2,3}{4,5,6}{7,8,9} => (3X3X3) => 147 148 149 157 158 159 167 168 169 247 248
                                    249 257 258 259 267 268 269 347 348 349 357
                                    358 359 367 368 369
```

Now, imagine how this complexity grows given that each element is a n-tuple:

```
{1..100}{1..100}         => (100X100)     => 10,000 elements (38.4 kB)
{1..100}{1..100}{1..100} => (100X100X100) => 1,000,000 elements (5.76 MB)
```

Although these examples are clearly contrived, they demonstrate how brace patterns can quickly grow out of control.

## Performance

Braces is not only screaming fast, it's also more accurate the other brace expansion libraries.

### Better algorithms

Fortunately there is a solution to the ["brace bomb" problem](#brace-matching-pitfalls): _don't expand brace patterns into an array when they're used for matching_.

Instead, convert the pattern into an optimized regular expression. This is easier said than done, and braces is the only library that does this currently.

**The proof is in the numbers**

Minimatch gets exponentially slower as patterns increase in complexity, braces does not. The following results were generated using `braces()` and `minimatch.braceExpand()`, respectively.

### Faster algorithms

When you need expansion, braces is still much faster.

_(the following results were generated using `braces.expand()` and `minimatch.braceExpand()`, respectively)_

| `{1..1000000}`  | `6.89 MB` (458ms 576μs)     | `6.89 MB` (1s 491ms 621μs)   |
| `{1..100000}`   | `588.89 kB` (20ms 728μs)    | `588.89 kB` (156ms 919μs)    |
| `{1..10000}`    | `48.89 kB` (2ms 202μs)      | `48.89 kB` (13ms 641μs)      |
| `{1..1000}`     | `3.89 kB` (1ms 796μs)       | `3.89 kB` (1ms 958μs)        |
| `{1..100}`      | `291 B` (424μs)             | `291 B` (211μs)              |
| `{1..10}`       | `20 B` (487μs)              | `20 B` (72μs)                |
| `{1..3}`        | `5 B` (166μs)               | `5 B` (27μs)                 |
