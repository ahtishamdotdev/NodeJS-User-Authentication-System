Extract the non-magic parent path from a glob string.

## Usage

```js
var globParent = require('glob-parent');

globParent('path/to*.js'); 
globParent('path/{to,from}'); 
globParent('path/!(to|from)'); 
globParent('path/?(to|from)'); 
globParent('path/+(to|from)'); 
globParent('path*'); 


globParent('path/foo/bar.js'); 
globParent('path/foo/'); 
globParent('path/foo'); 
```

## API

### `globParent(maybeGlobString, [options])`

Takes a string and returns the part of the path before the glob begins. Be aware of Escaping rules and Limitations below.

#### options

```js
{
  
  flipBackslashes: true
}
```

## Escaping

The following characters have special significance in glob patterns and must be escaped if you want them to be treated as regular path characters:

- `?` (question mark) unless used as a path segment alone
- `*` (asterisk)
- `|` (pipe)
- `(` (opening parenthesis)
- `)` (closing parenthesis)
- `{` (opening curly brace)
- `}` (closing curly brace)
- `[` (opening bracket)
- `]` (closing bracket)

**Example**

```js
globParent('foo/[bar]/') 
globParent('foo/\\[bar]/') 
```

## Limitations

### Braces & Brackets
This library attempts a quick and imperfect method of determining which path
parts have glob magic without fully parsing/lexing the pattern. There are some
advanced use cases that can trip it up, such as nested braces where the outer
pair is escaped and the inner one contains a path separator. If you find
yourself in the unlikely circumstance of being affected by this or need to
ensure higher-fidelity glob handling in your library, it is recommended that you
pre-process your input with [expand-braces] and/or [expand-brackets].

### Windows
Backslashes are not valid path separators for globs. If a path with backslashes
is provided anyway, for simple cases, glob-parent will replace the path
separator for you and return the non-glob parent path (now with
forward-slashes, which are still valid as Windows path separators).

This cannot be used in conjunction with escape characters.

```js

globParent('C:\\Program Files \\(x86\\)\\*.ext') 


globParent('C:/Program Files\\(x86\\)/*.ext') 
```

If you are using escape characters for a pattern without path parts (i.e.
relative to `cwd`), prefix with `./` to avoid confusing glob-parent.

```js

globParent('foo \\[bar]') 
globParent('foo \\[bar]*') 


globParent('./foo \\[bar]') 
globParent('./foo \\[bar]*') 
```
