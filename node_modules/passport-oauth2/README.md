# passport-oauth2

General-purpose OAuth 2.0 authentication strategy for [Passport](https:

This module lets you authenticate using OAuth 2.0 in your Node.js applications.
By plugging into Passport, OAuth 2.0-based sign in can be easily and
unobtrusively integrated into any application or framework that supports
[Connect](https:
[Express](https:

Note that this strategy provides generic OAuth 2.0 support.  In many cases, a
provider-specific strategy can be used instead, which cuts down on unnecessary
configuration, and accommodates any provider-specific quirks.  See the
[list](https:
providers.

Developers who need to implement authentication against an OAuth 2.0 provider
that is not already supported are encouraged to sub-class this strategy.  If you
choose to open source the new provider-specific strategy, please add it to the
list so other people can find it.

## Install

    $ npm install passport-oauth2

## Usage

#### Configure Strategy

The OAuth 2.0 authentication strategy authenticates users using a third-party
account and OAuth 2.0 tokens.  The provider's OAuth 2.0 endpoints, as well as
the client identifer and secret, are specified as options.  The strategy
requires a `verify` callback, which receives an access token and profile,
and calls `cb` providing a user.

```js
passport.use(new OAuth2Strategy({
    authorizationURL: 'https:
    tokenURL: 'https:
    clientID: EXAMPLE_CLIENT_ID,
    clientSecret: EXAMPLE_CLIENT_SECRET,
    callbackURL: "http:
  },
  function(accessToken, refreshToken, profile, cb) {
    User.findOrCreate({ exampleId: profile.id }, function (err, user) {
      return cb(err, user);
    });
  }
));
```

#### Authenticate Requests

Use `passport.authenticate()`, specifying the `'oauth2'` strategy, to
authenticate requests.

For example, as route middleware in an [Express](http:
application:

```js
app.get('/auth/example',
  passport.authenticate('oauth2'));

app.get('/auth/example/callback',
  passport.authenticate('oauth2', { failureRedirect: '/login' }),
  function(req, res) {
    
    res.redirect('/');
  });
```
