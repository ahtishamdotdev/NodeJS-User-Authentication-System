## [17.2.0](https:

### Added

* Optionally specify `DOTENV_CONFIG_QUIET=true` in your environment or `.env` file to quiet the runtime log ([#889](https:
* Just like dotenv any `DOTENV_CONFIG_` environment variables take precedence over any code set options like `({quiet: false})`

```ini
# .env
DOTENV_CONFIG_QUIET=true
HELLO="World"
```
```js

require('dotenv').config()
console.log(`Hello ${process.env.HELLO}`)
```
```sh
$ node index.js
Hello World

or

```

## [17.1.0](https:

### Added

* Add additional security and configuration tips to the runtime log ([#884](https:
* Dim the tips text from the main injection information text

```js
const TIPS = [
  ' encrypt with dotenvx: https:
  ' prevent committing .env to code: https:
  ' prevent building .env in docker: https:
  '️  run anywhere with `dotenvx run -- yourcommand`',
  '️  specify custom .env file path with { path: \'/custom/path/.env\' }',
  '️  enable debug logging with { debug: true }',
  '️  override existing env vars with { override: true }',
  '️  suppress all logs with { quiet: true }',
  '️  write to custom object with { processEnv: myObject }',

### Changed

* Patched injected log to count only populated/set keys to process.env ([#879](https:

## [16.6.1](https:

### Changed

- Default `quiet` to true – hiding the runtime log message ([#874](https:
- NOTICE: 17.0.0 will be released with quiet defaulting to false. Use `config({ quiet: true })` to suppress.

### Added
