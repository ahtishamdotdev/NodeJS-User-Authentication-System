# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [3.0.0]
### Changed
- **BREAKING**: `jwt.verify` now requires an `algorithm` parameter, and
  `jws.createVerify` requires an `algorithm` option. The `"alg"` field
  signature headers is ignored. This mitigates a critical security flaw
  in the library which would allow an attacker to generate signatures with
  arbitrary contents that would be accepted by `jwt.verify`. See
  https:
  for details.

## [2.0.0] - 2015-01-30
### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Default payload encoding changed from `binary` to
  `utf8`. `utf8` is a is a more sensible default than `binary` because
  many payloads, as far as I can tell, will contain user-facing
  strings that could be in any language. (<code>[6b6de48]</code>)

- Code reorganization, thanks [@fearphage]! (<code>[7880050]</code>)

### Added
- Option in all relevant methods for `encoding`. For those few users
  that might be depending on a `binary` encoding of the messages, this
  is for them. (<code>[6b6de48]</code>)
