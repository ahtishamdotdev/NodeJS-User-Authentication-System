<!-- start -->

Standard Schema is a common interface designed to be implemented by JavaScript and TypeScript schema libraries.

The goal is to make it easier for ecosystem tools to accept user-defined type validators, without needing to write custom logic or adapters for each supported library. And since Standard Schema is a specification, they can do so with no additional runtime dependencies. Integrate once, validate anywhere.

## Who designed it?

The spec was designed by the creators of Zod, Valibot, and ArkType. Recent versions of these libraries already implement the spec (see the [full list of compatible libraries](#what-schema-libraries-implement-the-spec) below).

## The interface

The specification consists of a single TypeScript interface `StandardSchemaV1` to be implemented by any schema library wishing to be spec-compliant.

This interface can be found below in its entirety. Libraries wishing to implement the spec can copy/paste the code block below into their codebase. It's also available at `@standard-schema/spec` on [npm](https:

```ts

export interface StandardSchemaV1<Input = unknown, Output = Input> {
  
  readonly '~standard': StandardSchemaV1.Props<Input, Output>;
}

export declare namespace StandardSchemaV1 {
  
  export interface Props<Input = unknown, Output = Input> {
    
    readonly version: 1;
    
    readonly vendor: string;
    
    readonly validate: (
      value: unknown
    ) => Result<Output> | Promise<Result<Output>>;
    
    readonly types?: Types<Input, Output> | undefined;
  }

  
  export type Result<Output> = SuccessResult<Output> | FailureResult;

  
  export interface SuccessResult<Output> {
    
    readonly value: Output;
    
    readonly issues?: undefined;
  }

  
  export interface FailureResult {
    
    readonly issues: ReadonlyArray<Issue>;
  }

  
  export interface Issue {
    
    readonly message: string;
    
    readonly path?: ReadonlyArray<PropertyKey | PathSegment> | undefined;
  }

  
  export interface PathSegment {
    
    readonly key: PropertyKey;
  }

  
  export interface Types<Input = unknown, Output = Input> {
    
    readonly input: Input;
    
    readonly output: Output;
  }

  
  export type InferInput<Schema extends StandardSchemaV1> = NonNullable<
    Schema['~standard']['types']
  >['input'];

  
  export type InferOutput<Schema extends StandardSchemaV1> = NonNullable<
    Schema['~standard']['types']
  >['output'];
}
```

## Design goals

The specification meets a few primary design objectives:

- **Support runtime validation.** Given a Standard Schema compatible validator, you should be able to validate data with it (duh). Any validation errors should be presented in a standardized format.
- **Support static type inference.** For TypeScript libraries that do type inference, the specification provides a standard way for them to "advertise" their inferred type, so it can be extracted and used by external tools.
- **Minimal.** It should be easy for libraries to implement this spec in a few lines of code that call their existing functions/methods.
- **Avoid API conflicts.** The entire spec is tucked inside a single object property called `~standard`, which avoids potential naming conflicts with the API surface of existing libraries.
- **Do no harm to DX.** The `~standard` property is tilde-prefixed to [de-prioritize it in autocompletion](https:

## How can my schema library implement the spec?

Schemas libraries that want to support Standard Schema must implement the `StandardSchemaV1` interface. Start by copying the specification file above into your library. It consists of types only.

Then implement the spec by adding the `~standard` property to your validator objects/instances. We recommend using `extends` / `implements` to ensure static agreement with the interface. It doesn't matter whether your schema library returns plain objects, functions, or class instances. The only thing that matters is that the `~standard` property is defined somehow.

Here's a simple worked example of a string validator that implements the spec.

```ts
import type {StandardSchemaV1} from '@standard-schema/spec';


interface StringSchema extends StandardSchemaV1<string> {
  type: 'string';
  message: string;
}


function string(message: string = 'Invalid type'): StringSchema {
  return {
    type: 'string',
    message,
    '~standard': {
      version: 1,
      vendor: 'valizod',
      validate(value) {
        return typeof value === 'string' ? {value} : {issues: [{message}]};
      },
    },
  };
}
```

We recommend defining the `~standard.validate()` function in terms of your library's existing validation functions/methods. Ideally implementing the spec only requires a handful of lines of code.

Avoid returning `Promise` from `~standard.validate()` unless absolutely necessary. Some third-party libraries may not support async validation.

## How do I accept Standard Schemas in my library?

Third-party libraries and frameworks can leverage the Standard Schema spec to accept user-defined schemas in a type-safe way.

To get started, copy and paste the specification file into your project. Alternatively (if you are okay with the extra dependency), you can install the `@standard-schema/spec` package from [npm](https:

```sh
npm install @standard-schema/spec       # npm
yarn add @standard-schema/spec          # yarn
pnpm add @standard-schema/spec          # pnpm
bun add @standard-schema/spec           # bun
deno add jsr:@standard-schema/spec      # deno
```

Here's is an simple example of a generic function that accepts an arbitrary spec-compliant validator and uses it to parse some data.

```ts
import type {StandardSchemaV1} from '@standard-schema/spec';

export async function standardValidate<T extends StandardSchemaV1>(
  schema: T,
  input: StandardSchemaV1.InferInput<T>
): Promise<StandardSchemaV1.InferOutput<T>> {
  let result = schema['~standard'].validate(input);
  if (result instanceof Promise) result = await result;

  
  if (result.issues) {
    throw new Error(JSON.stringify(result.issues, null, 2));
  }

  return result.value;
}
```

This concise function can accept inputs from any spec-compliant schema library.

```ts
import * as z from 'zod';
import * as v from 'valibot';
import {type} from 'arktype';

const zodResult = await standardValidate(z.string(), 'hello');
const valibotResult = await standardValidate(v.string(), 'hello');
const arktypeResult = await standardValidate(type('string'), 'hello');
```

## FAQ

These are the most frequently asked questions about Standard Schema. If your question is not listed, feel free to create an issue.

### Do I need to add `@standard-schema/spec` as a dependency?

No. The `@standard-schema/spec` package is completely optional. You can just copy and paste the types into your project. We guarantee no breaking changes without a major version bump.

If you don't mind additional dependencies, you can add `@standard-schema/spec` as a dependency and consume it with `import type`. The `@standard-schema/spec` package contains no runtime code and only exports types.

### Can I add it as a dev dependency?

Despite being types-only, you should _not_ install `@standard-schema/spec` as a dev dependency. By accepting Standard Schemas as part of your public API, the Standard Schema interface becomes a part of your library's public API. As such, it _must_ be available whenever/wherever your library gets installed, even in production installs. For this to happen, it must be installed as a regular dependency.

### Why did you prefix the `~standard` property with `~`?

The goal of prefixing the key with `~` is to both avoid conflicts with existing API surfaces and to de-prioritize these keys in auto-complete. The `~` character is one of the few ASCII characters that occurs after `A-Za-z0-9` lexicographically, so VS Code puts these suggestions at the bottom of the list.

![Screenshot showing the de-prioritization of the `~` prefix keys in VS Code.](https:

### Why not use a symbol key?

In TypeScript, using a plain `Symbol` inline as a key always collapses to a simple `symbol` type. This would cause conflicts with other schema properties that use symbols.

```ts
const object = {
  [Symbol.for('~output')]: 'some data',
};

```

Unique symbols can also be declared in a "nominal" way that won't collapse. In this case the symbol key is sorted alphabetically in autocomplete according to the symbol's variable name.

![Screenshot showing the prioritization of external symbols in VS Code](https:

Thus, these symbol keys don't get sorted to the bottom of the autocomplete list, unlike tilde-prefixed string keys.

### How to only allow synchronous validation?

The `~validate` function might return a synchronous value _or_ a `Promise`. If you only accept synchronous validation, you can simply throw an error if the returned value is an instance of `Promise`. Libraries are encouraged to preferentially use synchronous validation whenever possible.

```ts
import type {StandardSchemaV1} from '@standard-schema/spec';

function validateInput(schema: StandardSchemaV1, data: unknown) {
  const result = schema['~standard'].validate(data);
  if (result instanceof Promise) {
    throw new TypeError('Schema validation must be synchronous');
  }
  
}
```
