## ip-address

`ip-address` is a library for validating and manipulating IPv4 and IPv6
addresses in JavaScript.

### Upgrading from 9.x to 10.x

The dependency on `jsbn` was removed thanks to
[michal-kocarek](https:
clarity, all methods with BigInteger in the name were renamed to BigInt.

#### Breaking changes

- `#fromBigInteger()` → `#fromBigInt()`; now returns a native BigInt
- `#bigInteger()` → `#bigInt()`; now returns a native BigInt

### Documentation

Documentation is available at [ip-address.js.org](http:

### Examples

```js
var Address6 = require('ip-address').Address6;

var address = new Address6('2001:0:ce49:7601:e866:efff:62c3:fffe');

var teredo = address.inspectTeredo();

teredo.client4;    
```

### Features

- Usable via CommonJS or ESM
- Parsing of all IPv6 notations
- Parsing of IPv6 addresses and ports from URLs with `Address6.fromURL(url)`
- Validity checking
- Decoding of the [Teredo
  information](http:
  in an address
- Whether one address is a valid subnet of another
- What special properties a given address has (multicast prefix, unique
  local address prefix, etc.)
- Number of subnets of a certain size in a given address
- Display methods
  - Hex, binary, and decimal
  - Canonical form
  - Correct form
  - IPv4-compatible (i.e. `::ffff:192.168.0.1`)
- Works in [node](http:
- ~1,600 test cases
