Use this package to easily convert various time formats to milliseconds.

## Examples

```js
ms('2 days')  
ms('1d')      
ms('10h')     
ms('2.5 hrs') 
ms('2h')      
ms('1m')      
ms('5s')      
ms('1y')      
ms('100')     
```

### Convert from milliseconds

```js
ms(60000)             
ms(2 * 60000)         
ms(ms('10 hours'))    
```

### Time format written-out

```js
ms(60000, { long: true })             
ms(2 * 60000, { long: true })         
ms(ms('10 hours'), { long: true })    
```

## Features

- Works both in [node](https:
- If a number is supplied to `ms`, a string with a unit is returned.
- If a string that contains the number is supplied, it returns it as a number (e.g.: it returns `100` for `'100'`).
- If you pass a string with a number and a valid unit, the number of equivalent ms is returned.

## Caught a bug?

1. [Fork](https:
2. Link the package to the global module directory: `npm link`
3. Within the module you want to test your local development instance of ms, just link it to the dependencies: `npm link ms`. Instead of the default one from npm, node will now use your clone of ms!

As always, you can run the tests using: `npm test`
