# base64 [![Build status](https:

_base64_ is a robust base64 encoder/decoder that is fully compatible with [`atob()` and `btoa()`](https:

## Installation

Via [npm](https:

```bash
npm install base-64
```

In a browser:

```html
<script src="base64.js"></script>
```

In [Narwhal](http:

```js
var base64 = require('base-64');
```

In [Rhino](http:

```js
load('base64.js');
```

Using an AMD loader like [RequireJS](http:

```js
require(
  {
    'paths': {
      'base64': 'path/to/base64'
    }
  },
  ['base64'],
  function(base64) {
    console.log(base64);
  }
);
```

## API

### `base64.version`

A string representing the semantic version number.

### `base64.encode(input)`

This function takes a byte string (the `input` parameter) and encodes it according to base64. The input data must be in the form of a string containing only characters in the range from U+0000 to U+00FF, each representing a binary byte with values `0x00` to `0xFF`. The `base64.encode()` function is designed to be fully compatible with [`btoa()` as described in the HTML Standard](https:

```js
var encodedData = base64.encode(input);
```

To base64-encode any Unicode string, [encode it as UTF-8 first](https:

```js
var base64 = require('base-64');
var utf8 = require('utf8');

var text = 'foo ¬© bar ùåÜ baz';
var bytes = utf8.encode(text);
var encoded = base64.encode(bytes);
console.log(encoded);

```

### `base64.decode(input)`

This function takes a base64-encoded string (the `input` parameter) and decodes it. The return value is in the form of a string containing only characters in the range from U+0000 to U+00FF, each representing a binary byte with values `0x00` to `0xFF`. The `base64.decode()` function is designed to be fully compatible with [`atob()` as described in the HTML Standard](https:

```js
var decodedData = base64.decode(encodedData);
```

To base64-decode UTF-8-encoded data back into a Unicode string, [UTF-8-decode it](https:

```js
var encoded = 'Zm9vIMKpIGJhciDwnYyGIGJheg==';
var bytes = base64.decode(encoded);
var text = utf8.decode(bytes);
console.log(text);

```

## Support

_base64_ is designed to work in at least Node.js v0.10.0, Narwhal 0.3.2, RingoJS 0.8-0.9, PhantomJS 1.9.0, Rhino 1.7RC4, as well as old and modern versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, and Internet Explorer.

## Unit tests & code coverage

After cloning this repository, run `npm install` to install the dependencies needed for development and testing. You may want to install Istanbul _globally_ using `npm install istanbul -g`.

Once that‚Äôs done, you can run the unit tests in Node using `npm test` or `node tests/tests.js`. To run the tests in Rhino, Ringo, Narwhal, and web browsers as well, use `grunt test`.

To generate the code coverage report, use `grunt cover`.
