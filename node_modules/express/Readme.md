## Quick Start

  The quickest way to get started with express is to utilize the executable [`express(1)`](https:

  Install the executable. The executable's major version will match Express's:

```bash
npm install -g express-generator@4
```

  Create the app:

```bash
express /tmp/foo && cd /tmp/foo
```

  Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

  Start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

## Philosophy

  The Express philosophy is to provide small, robust tooling for HTTP servers, making
  it a great solution for single page applications, websites, hybrids, or public
  HTTP APIs.

  Express does not force you to use any specific ORM or template engine. With support for over
  14 template engines via [@ladjs/consolidate](https:
  you can quickly craft your perfect framework.

## Examples

  To view the examples, clone the Express repository:

```bash
git clone https:
```

  Then install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

  Then run whichever example you want:

```bash
node examples/content-negotiation
```
