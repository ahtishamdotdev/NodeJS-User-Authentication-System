# whatwg-url

whatwg-url is a full implementation of the WHATWG [URL Standard](https:

## Specification conformance

whatwg-url is currently up to date with the URL spec up to commit [6c78200](https:

For `file:` URLs, whose [origin is left unspecified](https:

whatwg-url does not yet implement any encoding handling beyond UTF-8. That is, the _encoding override_ parameter does not exist in our API.

## API

### The `URL` and `URLSearchParams` classes

The main API is provided by the [`URL`](https:

### Low-level URL Standard API

The following methods are exported for use by places like jsdom that need to implement things like [`HTMLHyperlinkElementUtils`](https:

- [URL parser](https:
- [Basic URL parser](https:
- [URL serializer](https:
- [Host serializer](https:
- [URL path serializer](https:
- [Serialize an integer](https:
- [Origin](https:
- [Set the username](https:
- [Set the password](https:
- [Has an opaque path](https:
- [Cannot have a username/password/port](https:
- [Percent decode bytes](https:
- [Percent decode a string](https:

The `stateOverride` parameter is one of the following strings:

- [`"scheme start"`](https:
- [`"scheme"`](https:
- [`"no scheme"`](https:
- [`"special relative or authority"`](https:
- [`"path or authority"`](https:
- [`"relative"`](https:
- [`"relative slash"`](https:
- [`"special authority slashes"`](https:
- [`"special authority ignore slashes"`](https:
- [`"authority"`](https:
- [`"host"`](https:
- [`"hostname"`](https:
- [`"port"`](https:
- [`"file"`](https:
- [`"file slash"`](https:
- [`"file host"`](https:
- [`"path start"`](https:
- [`"path"`](https:
- [`"opaque path"`](https:
- [`"query"`](https:
- [`"fragment"`](https:

The URL record type has the following API:

- [`scheme`](https:
- [`username`](https:
- [`password`](https:
- [`host`](https:
- [`port`](https:
- [`path`](https:
- [`query`](https:
- [`fragment`](https:

These properties should be treated with care, as in general changing them will cause the URL record to be in an inconsistent state until the appropriate invocation of `basicURLParse` is used to fix it up. You can see examples of this in the URL Standard, where there are many step sequences like "4. Set context object’s url’s fragment to the empty string. 5. Basic URL parse _input_ with context object’s url as _url_ and fragment state as _state override_." In between those two steps, a URL record is in an unusable state.

The return value of "failure" in the spec is represented by `null`. That is, functions like `parseURL` and `basicURLParse` can return _either_ a URL record _or_ `null`.

### `whatwg-url/webidl2js-wrapper` module

This module exports the `URL` and `URLSearchParams` [interface wrappers API](https:

## Development instructions

First, install [Node.js](https:

    npm install

To run tests:

    npm test

To generate a coverage report:

    npm run coverage

To build and run the live viewer:

    npm run prepare
    npm run build-live-viewer

Serve the contents of the `live-viewer` directory using any web server.
